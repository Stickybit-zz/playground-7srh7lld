# Welcome!

This Java template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.


TOTOT
TATA
 
String message = "Hello World!";
System.out.println(message);

# Java Programming Tests
## Take a Java test
The CodinGame Java online tests assess candidates' skills. They are perfect for pre-employment screening for developers. Most of the coding interview tools focus only on the candidates' ability to write efficient algorithms but algorithms are a tiny part of software development, mastering them is one skill among several other important skills. We are providing tests covering a wide scope of technical characteristics to evaluate candidates' ability to write good Java programs.

## Java Language
These questions check the candidate’s ability to use functionalities that are well-known to Java developers. Using the correct APIs and data structures determine the candidate's level of experience in the practice of the Java programming language. This skill is particularly important if you are looking for a developer who has to be quickly operational in a Java working environment.

An example of very simple task we provide consists in writing a method which takes a string str as parameter and returns true if it equals to "Hello World", false otherwise.

```java runnable
// { autofold
public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {
// }

isHelloWord("Hello World");

// { autofold
}
// }
```


Problem Solving
This skill corresponds to the candidate's ability to evaluate and resolve a problem by writing an efficient algorithm in Java. Any developers should be able to solve simple problems but advanced analytical skills and logical reasoning are essential when your are hiring Java R&D developers. Our exercises cover several topics like the graph theory, dynamic programming and the number theory.

An example of simple problem is: From a given array of natural numbers, returns the distance between the two closest numbers.
A basic solution consists in: for each number, compare it to the other numbers to find the two closest. This solution takes a long time to process large data sets, its time complexity is O(n²) and it will fail on some of our test cases. A more efficient solution consists in a two steps algorithm: 1. sort the array using a built-in function like Arrays.sort() 2. iterate through the sorted array and compare each number to the previous one. Here the time complexity is O(n log(n)).

Design
Having a good understanding of the design patterns, object-oriented programming and unit tests give an indication of the candidate's ability to implement standard solutions to common problems. A developer with a good level of proficiency in this skill will contribute to increase the maintainability and the extensibility of your applications. This skill is particularly important if you are looking for an senior Java developer who will have to work on the architecture of your applications to design long-term solutions.

This is a simple question example: Among these Java method declarations, which is usually the preferred one?

public HashMap getTable()
public Map getTable()
public Hashtable getTable()
Readability
This metric focus on the candidate’s ability to follow the Java guidelines and best practices. A high score means that the code is easily understandable by other programmers, easier to maintain and to debug. The readability score is only available if the candidate has given a correct solution to a programming exercise. For example, private String Name; will impact the readability score because it does not respect the Java naming convention.

Reliability
Reliability refers to the candidate's ability to achieve solutions that address specific cases like corner and edge cases. The higher this skill, the higher the developer anticipates possible errors and minimizes those to build robust programs.
